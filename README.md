_Test-driven development (TDD) is a software development approach where developers write automated tests before writing the actual code. This iterative process helps ensure that the code meets the desired requirements and remains robust throughout development. - ChatGPT_

This project is more or less an introduction to TDD and contains excercises to practice Test Driven Development.

As a practice/excercies project there is not much details to be provided in the README.
